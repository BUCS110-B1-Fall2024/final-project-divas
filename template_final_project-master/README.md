## Project Description

We are planning to create a game wherein the user is able to fish from a river which contains a variety of fish. In the corner of the screen, there will be a counter displaying the number of each different kind of fish that the player has caught. The player will be able to select from different challenges, such as catching a certain number of fish within a time limit, for instance.
